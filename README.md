# Second assignment for Programacion 2 (Second semester at ORT University)
I created a web page where two different user's profiles (Admin and Customer) can log in and out. To do so, I used .NET to create a MVC. The users have different features: 
for instance, Admin can sign in while customer can not. I attached the UML model where the different classes can be seen by SISTEMA. This class manages the comunication 
with the console and allows to validate the entries. I have also performed some valiation before reaching the SISTEMA through JavaScript.
